## FreeCodeCamp React Project - Portfolio

## User Story
- [ ] I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
- [ ] I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
- [ ] I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built.
- [ ] I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

## Thoughts
This was a huge project for me at the time, and I was heavily influenced by the old version of Treehouse website - it can be seen in the sidebar and section structure.

This is the second version, remade using React. The first version was really had to edit and update, because the code was very entangled.

I suppose it's OK as a first portfolio project, but from time to time I think of creating something professional looking!
